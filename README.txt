This is the code challenge made by Preston Fitzgerald for an application to BYU Application Engineering. Copying or referencing this app for use in future code challenges is considered cheating and is strictly prohibited. 

The actual programming work for this was done between 7:45 and 11:45 the morning of November 15. 

The executable file is named HangmanGame.exe and is found in the publish folder. 

Program.cs is the main controller for the game. It controls the flow. I tried to keep as little in here as possible and put as much of the functionality as I could into functions.cs

hangmanGame.cs is the game class. All data for the game is stored there. By storing it there, I can erase all game data by simply creating a new game. 

Function.cs is the brains of the operation. It contains all of the functionality to guess and evaluate the game. Yes, I did my the ASCII art myself. It keeps all of the functionality of the app in one easy to access place.
